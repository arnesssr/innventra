## Important Notes
1. Both applications need to run simultaneously for full functionality
2. Admin dashboard publishes products to localStorage (development)
3. Storefront reads products from localStorage (development)
4. For production, replace localStorage with proper database

## Environment Variables Required
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_key    # Auth provider key

## Common Issues
1. If storefront shows blank page:
   - Ensure both servers are running
   - Check localStorage for published products
   - Verify correct ports (5173 for admin, 5174 for store)

2. If publishing fails:
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify product status is 'published'
   - Clear localStorage and try again

## Data Flow
Admin Dashboard -> localStorage -> Storefront
(In production: Admin Dashboard -> Database -> Storefront)
